# How to contribute

## Overview

`So You Just Learned` is an open source collection of resources designed as an entry point for people just learning about inequity in the tech industry. This is not meant to act as a comprehensive guide. It is, however, a good jumping off point for people who want to learn more in good faith.

This document aims to reduce the emotional labor of marginalized people in tech. Having to rehash grievances and repeatedly explain marginalization and bias is an unhealthy emotional burden. This contributes to animosity and burnout within the tech industry. This project is a small step forward toward alleviating some of that burden.

## What belongs in this project?

1. Resources for understanding emotional labor and marginalization in the tech industry

2. Links to first person accounts of marginalization in the tech industry

3. Links to resources and organizations that support marginalized people that need donations and/or volunteer work.
